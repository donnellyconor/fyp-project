Title: The Modification of an EPV(Expected Point Value) possesion metric for use in field sports(soccer)

The aim of this Final Year Project is to modify an existing sports analytics metric, Expected Point Value (EPV) which is currently used
for basketball, for use in fields sports which will be football in the case of this project. As well as the implementation of this newly
developed metric in to an easy to use application that can be used by football coaches and players. The user can also use the application
to annotate videos of gameplay and develop a table of events that can be each be individually easily accessed and viewed.
EPV is represented by a particular possession by a particular player in a particular position on the field of play. Analysis was conducted
on the current EPV metric by the reproduction of the Cervone trials using demo EPV code executed using the R programming language. The
project application was scripted in Java programming language and is comprised of three main screens, video annotation, video analysis and
Expected Goal Value (EGV) windows. The modified analytical model EGV metric is calculated by vector scaling of three variables which
include the players distance from goal, the angle of shot taken and the players quality, to produce a number that indicates whether the
player made the correct decision. The project has fulfilled its set objectives and a functioning, user-friendly application has been
created.
